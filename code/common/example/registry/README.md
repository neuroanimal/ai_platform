# Registry Example

This directory contains executable examples demonstrating
how to use the plugin and registry mechanism in ai-platform.

Purpose:
- explain registry-based architecture
- show explicit plugin registration
- demonstrate deterministic dependency resolution
- provide reference usage patterns for future implementations

Rules:
- examples must be executable and importable
- no production logic is allowed
- no side effects on module import
- no automatic discovery or reflection
- explicit registration only

Scope:
- plugin lifecycle demonstration
- backend switching patterns
- adapter registration examples
- agent and LLM orchestration patterns

These examples are part of architectural documentation
and should be kept simple, explicit, and stable over time.
